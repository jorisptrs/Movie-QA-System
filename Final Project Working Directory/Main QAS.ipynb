    "# Advanced Question Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to write a more flexible version of the interactive QA system. As in the previous assignment, the system should be able to take a question in natural language (English) as input, analyse the question, and generate a SPARQL query for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment  // Additional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure that your system can analyse at least two more question types. E.g. questions that start with *which*, *when*, where the property is expressed by a verb, etc.\n",
    "* Apart from the techniques introduced last week (matching tokens on the basis of their lemma or part-of-speech), also include at least one pattern where you use the dependency relations to find the relevant property or entity in the question. \n",
    "* Include 10 examples of questions that your system can handle, and that illustrate the fact that you cover additional question types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a non-representative list of questios and question types to consider. See the list with all questions for more examples\n",
    "\n",
    "* For what movie did Leonardo DiCaprio win an Oscar?\n",
    "* How long is Pulp Fiction?\n",
    "* How many episodes does Twin Peaks have?\n",
    "* In what capital was the film The Fault in Our Stars, filmed?\n",
    "* In what year was The Matrix released?\n",
    "* When did Alan Rickman die?\n",
    "* Where was Morgan Freeman born?\n",
    "* Which actor played Aragorn in Lord of the Rings?\n",
    "* Which actors played the role of James Bond\n",
    "* Who directed The Shawshank Redemption?\n",
    "* Which movies are directed by Alice Wu?\n"
